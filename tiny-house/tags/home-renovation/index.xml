        <description>can you fillet a block in autocad.The fillet command can be used to add round corners to the sharp edges of the drawing. Two straight lines i can fillet, but i canˇt fillet two arcs or something else. Still, if you need to create a fillet or curved edge, autocad offers a specific command that allows you to control the radius of a fillet. These are what you can do to make your autocad files smaller.</description>
